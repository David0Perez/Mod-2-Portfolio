# Mod-2-Portfolio
I will be building a portfolio from scratch

This is my first time creating a html from scratch with css, it has a rollercoaster and it is only the beginning, unfortunatley, but it has been fun learning.

I was able to do some of what the assignment entailed, like creating links to the about me, work, and contacts which go the designated sections. As well as creating effects to the buttons on the navbar.

I was having issues with labeling titled images and adjusting sizes.
